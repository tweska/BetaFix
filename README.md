# BetaFix
BetaFix lets you enjoy Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 with working authentication, skins
and capes! BetaFix does not rely on a third party proxy, everything is fixed
client-side.

The bigest drawback of methods that rely on third party proxies is that you as
a user do not have control over the proxy. With BetaFix you can verify and
build the mod yourself!

## Build instructions
To build the mod from scratch, simply run:
```shell
./build.sh
```

## Installation instructions
BetaFix can easily be installed in [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download).

Assuming you have created a clean Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 instance and build the
mod yourself or grabbed the ZIP-file from the latest release, follow these
instructions:
1. On the right-hand-side, click on `Edit Instance`.
2. On the right-hand-side, click on `Add to Minecraft.jar`.
3. Navigate to the `BetaFix.zip` file and open it.
4. BetaFix is now installed as a JAR-mod, the `Version` tab should look like
this:

## Acknowledgements
The creation of this fix was made very easy thanks to the
[RetroMCP-Java](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) tool and
